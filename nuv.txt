Welcome to nuv!

Nuv is an all-in-one development kit to setup and run Nuvolaris, a distribution of Apache OpenWhisk.

You can learn about Apache Openwhisk on https://openwhisk.apache.org/documentation.html

Nuv embeds all you need to develop for Apache OpenWhisk in a single binary.

Currently it supports developing locally using Docker, but it will be extended to support more Kubernetes (idally, all).

To setup your local cluster, use:

nuv setup --devcluster

Now you can work with it. Apache OpenWhisk uses `wsk` to interact with it.

Nuv embeds wsk, just use `nuv wsk` wherever in documentation you are instructed to use `wsk`.

Also you have the playground accessible in http://localhost:3232/
